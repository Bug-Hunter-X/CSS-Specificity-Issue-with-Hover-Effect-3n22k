The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
}

.container .inner {
  width: 200px;
}

.container.inner {
  width: 150px;
}

.container.inner:hover {
  width: 250px;
}

.container .inner:hover {
  width: 300px; /* This is the problematic selector */
}
```

The issue arises when attempting to override the hover effect on the `.container.inner` class by creating an additional selector of `.container .inner:hover`. Although it seems intuitively correct, the second `:hover` selector has lower specificity than `.container.inner:hover` and therefore won't override the first style.
